This ReadMe provides information about the CSP eurusd Strategy code. It is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website: [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com).

## Code Description

The CSP eurusd Strategy code is an expert advisor (EA) written in MQL5 language for the MetaTrader 5 platform. It is designed to trade the EUR/USD currency pair.

### Input Parameters

The code allows users to set the following input parameters:

- `StopLoss`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit level in pips.

### Global Variables

The code uses the following global variables:

- `isLongTradeOpen`: A boolean variable to track if a long trade is open.
- `isShortTradeOpen`: A boolean variable to track if a short trade is open.

### Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the EA. Indicators are added and variables are initialized in this function.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. Cleanup and resource release tasks are performed in this function.

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the price. It checks for candlestick patterns and generates trading signals based on the patterns detected. It also checks for exit signals to close trades.
